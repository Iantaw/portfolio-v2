            <p>Some things I want to learn:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>React Native</li>
                <li>How to make minecraft mods</li>
                <li>Becoming good at chess</li>

            <p>We see lots of blank space in this portfolio, waiting to be filled. <br> We think to ourselves, "Once I finish this, Harvard might consider me!" or "I just need to do one more coding problem, and then maybe I'll get the job". <br> However sometimes we need people who step out of the traditional path, they don't care about what others think, <br> They admire simplicity, they admire having a half-empty portfolio, and a half-full life. <br> My conclusion is that at the end of the day, there's always going to be a new job or university or programming language. <br> Just stick with one or two things, become the master in them, and nothing can stop you. <br> <br>Ian Tawileh - 2025</p>
